# About me
I am an experienced financial settlement specialist and have also pursued my long-time passion –
professional dog training – as my second job. Recently I’ve started to be more interested in IT. When I was thinking about changing my career path, I talked with friends working as Software Testers. When I heard more about this profession, I got really interested, because I like to spot discrepancies and I have an inquisitive mind. I would like to gain experience in Software Testing – I’ve completed an individual Software Testing course and I really liked it. I’m open to new challenges and learning new skills.
